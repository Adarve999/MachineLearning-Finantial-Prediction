# MachineLearning-FinantialPrediction
The aim of this practice is to apply the concepts learned about constructing linear models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and decision trees to a dynamic prediction problem in a financial context. The student should be able to implement these Machine Learning models in Python, including the associated metrics and other analyses.
